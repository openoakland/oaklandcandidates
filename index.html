<p><a href="http://openoakland.org">OpenOakland: a Code for
America Brigade</a> is a new
technology innovation organization created by local technologists, open
government advocates and data geeks with an interest in supporting and
educating government staff and implementing tools to help open, improve
and engage our local governments.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of
the Obama administration&rsquo;s <a
 href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open">Open Government
Initiative</a>, we&rsquo;re
joining local open government <a
 href="http://opengovernmentinitiative.org">groups</a>
around the country to advocate for, and support, more transparent,
effective government.</p>
<p>Open government is important
for a thriving and accountable democracy. With the technology that
exists today, government and citizen can interact with one another in
ways that were unimaginable before. By opening conduits from which the
public can communicate with government and access the pertinent
information about their city, the needs of the public are better served.</p>
<p>One powerful example of how a
commitment to open government can better serve the public is by
offering taxpayer-produced data online in a free and easily accessible
format. A web portal can be a clearinghouse for public data without the
need to engage in potentially lengthy and costly public record
requests. Such <a href="http://data.sfgov.org">initiatives</a>,
which can be powered with open source technology as we are <a
 href="http://data.openoakland.org">demonstrating</a>,
could save the city money and time while also allowing the public easy
access to important information immediately.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re asking all 2012
candidates for City Council and City Attorney to express support for
open government principles by signing the candidate open government
pledge, below. Similar pledges were signed by mayoral candidates in <a
 href="http://sf.govfresh.com/sf-mayoral-candidates-an-open-government-pledge-for-san-francisco/">San
Francisco</a> in 2011 and <a href="http://honolulu.govfresh.com/">Honolulu</a>
this year.</p>
<p>We all recognize that Oakland
is poised for greatness, however this will only be fully realized
should governance could be improved. We thank candidates for showing
they believe in Oakland through their candidacies. We want all
candidates and voters to know that the Oakland tech community is eager
to pitch in to help you make good, responsive, transparent, open
government a reality!</p>
<h2 id="candidates">Candidates</h2>
As candidates respond to the Open Government Pledge, we will add their
names below, and spread the word via social media and news releases. We
are contacting each candidate. You can find a complete list of
candidates at the Alameda County Registrar of Voters (<a
 href="http://www.acgov.org/rov/documents/2012-11-06OfficialCandidateList.pdf">pdf</a>).
Please urge your candidates to respond.

<h2 id="pledge">Oakland
Council and Attorney Candidate 2012 Open Government Pledge</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Open
Government&rdquo; is the movement to improve government by making
it more transparent, participatory, and collaborative. Open Government
will help build the public&rsquo;s trust and satisfaction in
government, will improve government&rsquo;s delivery of services,
and will create new opportunities for innovation.</p>
  <p>I, _______________________,
commit to support the following principles of Open Government:</p>
  <p><b>Transparency</b>:
To increase accountability, promote informed public participation, and
create economic development opportunities, the city shall expand access
to information.</p>
  <p><b>Participation</b>:
To create more informed and effective policies, the city shall enhance
and expand opportunities for the public to participate throughout
decision-making processes.</p>
  <p><b>Collaboration</b>:
To more effectively fulfill its obligations to citizens, the city will
enhance and expand its practices of cooperation among city departments,
other governmental agencies, the public, and non-profit and private
organizations.</p>
  <p>With the rise of new
technologies and an increasingly connected population, there is a
growing public desire for government leaders and entities to adopt
these Open Government principles. I will take steps so that Oakland
responds to its citizens&rsquo; desire to be more involved in the
operations and decision making of their government.</p>
  <p>By supporting Open Government
efforts, Oakland will build on and enhance opportunities for citizens
to inform government; will further develop the city&rsquo;s
transparency and accountability; and will support opportunities for
innovation and economic development.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, I will support
developing a legal framework to grow a culture of Open Government and
will seek feedback about the effectiveness of our Open Government
efforts.I commit to working with city officials, departments, and the
public to implement Open Government in Oakland.</p>
